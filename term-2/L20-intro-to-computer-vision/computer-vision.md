# Computer Vision

Deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos

* Automate tasks that the human visual system can do

**Visual Perception**: act of observing patterns and objects through sight/visual input

* Used to build a visual system to build a model of the physical world

**In A.I**:

* Used to perceive and construct a physical model of the world
  * -> AI system can then take appropraite action
* N.B: Just one of many methods A.I systems use for perception
* i.e. self-driving cars:
  * Intelligently detect lane markings, vehicles, pedestrians etc -> navigate correctly and safely

## Computer Vision Pipeline

Series of steps most computer vision applications will take.

1.  Input Data
    * Images/Image frames
2.  Pre-Processing
    * Noise reduction
    * Scaling
    * Change colour spaces
3.  Selecting Areas of Interest
    * Object detection
    * Image segmentation
4.  Feature Extraction
    * Find facial markers -> curve of mouth, eyes, etc
5.  Prediction/Recognition
    * Object recognition
    * Feature matching
    * Facial expression recognition
    * Emotion prediction
6.  Action
