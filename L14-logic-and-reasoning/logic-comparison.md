# Comparing First Order Logic, Propositional Logic and Probability Theory
* Ontological Commitment = What the logic says about the world
* Epistemological Commitment = Beliefs agents using logics can have

|                     |      Ontological (World)      | Epistemological (Belief) |

## State Representation
* Atomic
    * Individual state with no 'pieces' inside of it
    * Can only say whether states are the same or not, or whether one is a goal
    * Used in search/problem solving
* Factored
    * State is factored into individual variables that are T/F
    * Propositional logic and Probability theory
* Structured
    * State can includes relationships between objects
    * First Order Logic
    * Programming languages
    * Databases
