Notes, work and projects for [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) (October 2017 cohort)

## Note on Projects

`projects` directory contains submodules for graded projects with starter/setup code initially cloned from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity). Each is managed within it's own repository.

## Note on `cloned.git`

Some directories may contain a `cloned.git` directory. These were repos initially cloned from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity) for started code but I felt didn't warrant their own repositories.
