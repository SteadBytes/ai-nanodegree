# Useful Definitions
**Heuristic** - Some additional piece of information - a rule, function or constraint that infoms an otherwise brute0force algorithm to act in a more optimal manner.
* Might not always find the best solution but is guaranteed to find a good solution in reasonable time.
* By sacrificing completeness it increases efficiency.
* Useful in solving tough problems which:
    * Cannot be solved any other way    
    * Are intractable
**Prior Probability** - 'Buest guess' at a probability before other evidence is taking into account. A probability as assessed before making reference to certain relevant observations, especially subjectively or on the assumption that all possible outcomes be given the same probability.
**Posterior Probability** - Probability after taking into account an observation.

**Complete Search** - Algorithm which always finds a goal if one exists
