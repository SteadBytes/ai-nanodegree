This script evaluates the performance of the custom_score evaluation
function against a baseline agent using alpha-beta search and iterative
deepening (ID) called `AB_Improved`. The three `AB_Custom` agents use
ID and alpha-beta search with the custom_score functions defined in
game_agent.py.

Agent Heuristics:
AB_Custom = avoid_corners_score
AB_Custom_2 = chase_opponent_score
AB_Custom_3 = weighted_chase_opponent_score
