# Ordered Sequences
Ordered sequence = List of values ordered by index:
* (S<sub>1</sub>,S<sub>2</sub>,S<sub>3</sub>,...,S<sub>P</sub>,)
* Index can just be order with no real interpretation or represent a **time stamp**

Example: 'my dog is the best':
* = (S<sub>1</sub>='my',S<sub>2</sub>='dog',S<sub>3</sub>='is',S<sub>4</sub>='the',S<sub>5</sub>='best)

* Real ordered sequences are a product of some **underlying process or processes**
    * i.e. Weather, Stock prices -> affected by many different processes
* Underlying processes are **black boxes** -> don't fully understand them
    * Model future values of a sequence mathematically **dependent on preceding values**
    * -> **Recursive sequence**
