# Hyperparameters

Values that must be set before applying a learning algorithm to a dataset.

* Depend on each task and data set

Main Categories:

* Optimizer Hyperparameters - related to training and optimization process
  * Learning rate
  * Mini batch size
  * Training epochs
* Model Hyperparamaters - relate to the structure of the model

  * Number of layers

## Learning Rate

* With well normalized inputs **0.01** is often a good starting point
