# Bayes Theorem
Describes the probability of an event, based on **prior knowledge** of conditions related to the event - observations.

## Definition
P(A|B) = (P(B|A)&middot;P(A)) / P(B)
 
 = likelihood * prior / marginal probability

Where A and B are events and P(B) != 0

* P(A) = **prior** or marginal probability  of A, doesn't take into account any onformation about B.
* P(A|B) = conditional probabiliy of A, given B. Called **posterior probaility** as it depends on an observation of B.
* P(B) = **prior** or marginal probability or B.
