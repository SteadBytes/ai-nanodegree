Notes, work and projects for [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) (October 2017 cohort)

## Note on Projects
`AIND-*` directories are graded projects with starter/setup code initially cloned from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity). The `.git` directory for each are renamed to `cloned.git` so that they aren't tracked as submodules in this repo. Cloning and re-naming the `cloned.git` directory to `.git` will allow specific commit history of the project repos to be viewed.
