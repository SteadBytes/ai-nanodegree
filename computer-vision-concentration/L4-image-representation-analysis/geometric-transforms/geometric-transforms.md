# Geometric Transforms

Modify the **positions** of pixels in an image:

* Change perspective
  * Angled text -> straight on
* Rotations
* Translations
* Scaling

Can more reliably measure/recognize image features:

* Measure curvature of a road from a 'birds eye view'
* Read text written at an angle
* Scanning and aligning text in a document
  * Document could be anything that requires scanning:
    * Label
    * Cheque
    * Barcode
    * Business cards
    * etc
